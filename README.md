# HandyGamepad

This is just a small utility app I've been using to control my Handy.

[HandyControl](https://discuss.eroscripts.com/t/handycontrol-0-7-0-script-player-with-remote-control-20-09-2020/94/33) is great, but four set positions wasn't enough for me, and I also wanted to be able to nudge the stroke speed and length with the D-Pad.

There are some super rough patches - don't move any of the sliders with your mouse or you'll queue up a billion unnecessary API calls!

I'm going to update this app soon using the SDK I developed more recently, but figured I should upload this anyway since it's somewhat useful as-is!
